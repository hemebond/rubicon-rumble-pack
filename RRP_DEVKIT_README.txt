So what is this archive?  Its a grab bag of stuff you may find useful 
if you want to develop new content using the mod entities.  It's 
untidy and incomplete - if you've experience with game development
then hopefully shouldn't come as a surprise.

The PSD sources are not included because they're heavy.

There is the QC source, based off the released QC of Rubicon2 and 
some odds and sods I've accumulated over the years from various 
projects, most notably RMQ.

There are some of the map sources, as well as some test maps. Locust
is not included, sorry.

I tried to be concise with the documentation in /docs but I'm sure
there will be things I missed - contact me at louismanning@gmail.com
if you have questions.

Good luck in your endeavours.  Only listen when its important to do so,
and never miss the opportunity when it is.

ijed / Louis
